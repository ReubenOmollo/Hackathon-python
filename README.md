1.Searching Algorithms
Ternary Search: Implement a Python ternary search for finding a specific element in a sorted array.
This algorithm should be efficient.
Search in Rotated Sorted Array: Design an algorithm that efficiently locates a specified target value within an array that has been sorted in ascending order and then rotated at an unknown pivot point.

2.Advanced String Manipulation
Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters: Write a function that finds the length of the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string.
Regular Expression Matching: Implement a function that supports regular expression matching with support for . and *.

3.Sorting Algorithms
